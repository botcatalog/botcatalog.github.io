# Welcome!
Hey! You're probably here because you want to submit your guide to this site.
And first thing I want to say: WELCOME! I'm very glad to see you there!
Your work is greatly appreciated, even if this is another guide to setting up another bot.

# Where can I submit?
To submit your guide go to **[creating new file on this project's GitHub page](https://github.com/botcatalog/guides/new/main/_posts)**

# Naming 
After logging in GitHub, look at the "Name your file" field 
![Name Field](/assets/posts/name_field.png)

Your post must have name that matches this pattern: ``YEAR-MONTH-DAY-<TITLE>`` (ex. ``2021-11-1-how-to-submit-guides.md``)

# Post metadata

You post should start with this part:
```yaml
---
title: "Your post title"
categories: ["Your", "post", "categories"]
date: YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR-MINUTE-SECOND +(-)TIMEZONE
tags: ["your", "post", "tags"]
---
```
Don't forget to replace placeholder with your post's actual title, categories, tags and date!

Example (this post's metadata):
```yaml
---
title: "How to submit guides"
categories: ["Guides","This platform"]
tags: ["guides", "writing-guide","how-to-write"]
date: 2021-11-1 20-50-00 +0300 # +0300 - UTC+3
---
```
