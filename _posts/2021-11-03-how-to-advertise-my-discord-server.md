## Backstory
Yesterday, I was sitting in the [my discord chat](https://findadiscord.com/servers/view/868937600663162960), and I was frustrating: There's only 100 members in the my server, and almost zero messages.
Then I remembered that my friend also has a [discord server](https://findadiscord.com/servers/view/185735119657500673) with over 20k people and constant chat messages.
I asked him: What's the trick?
He said: No tricks, only [Find a Discord](https://findadiscord.com)
I looked at this site, and was so impressed that I wrote a whole guide on how to grow your discord community on this wonderful platform.

## Adding your server

I was amazed at the simplicity of adding a server: no bots and eternal invites, you just need to go to the server settings and click on 1 checkmark.

So, steps:
1. Go to [Discord Servers](https://findadiscord.com)
2. Press "Log in" in the top navigation bar

3. Log in
4. Press on your username and avatar

5. Tap on "Add server"

7. Follow instructions about how to enable widget:
  - Go to your server's server settings
